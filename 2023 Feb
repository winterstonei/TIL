- Pins in DDR5 (JEDEC Standard)
- Data pins (64ea) / Power (Tot: 20ea - VDD: 8ea / VDDQ: 8ea / VPP: 2ea / VDDSPD: 1ea / VDD2DRX: 1ea)
- CA (Tot: 25ea / CA: 9ea [0:8] / CKE: 1ea / CS: 4ea [0:3] / ODT: 4ea [0:3] / PAR: 1ea / DMI: 2ea [0:1] / DMO: 2ea [0:1] / DBI: 2ea [0:1])
    CA[0:8]: These are the main command/address pins and are used to transmit memory addresses and command signals between the memory controller and the memory module. These signals are organized into 9-bit groups called "CA bus segments" and are used to address individual rows and columns of memory cells, activate or precharge rows, and initiate various read/write/refresh operations.

    CKE: Clock Enable. This signal is used to enable/disable the internal clock of the memory module.

    CS[0:3]: Chip Select. These signals are used to select or deselect the memory module in multi-rank memory configurations.

    ODT[0:3]: On-Die Termination. These signals are used to control the impedance of the memory module's output drivers to optimize signal quality and reduce reflections.

    PAR: Parity. This signal is used to transmit parity information for error detection in memory accesses.

    DMI[0:1]: Data Mask In. These signals are used to mask off certain data bits during write operations.

    DMO[0:1]: Data Mask Out. These signals are used to indicate which data bits are valid during read operations.

    DBI: Data Bus Inversion. This signal is used to enable or disable data bus inversion for power optimization.

- Data Smoothing : Gaussian From chatGPT
Gaussian smoothing is a type of smoothing or filtering method that uses a Gaussian function to convolve with the signal. The Gaussian function is a bell-shaped curve that is symmetric around the mean and has the maximum value at the mean.
To apply Gaussian smoothing to a signal, we convolve the signal with a Gaussian kernel, which is simply a discrete approximation of the Gaussian function. The width of the Gaussian kernel (i.e., the standard deviation of the Gaussian function) determines the amount of smoothing: a wider kernel results in more smoothing.
The advantages of Gaussian smoothing are that it is computationally efficient and it preserves the shape of the signal better than some other smoothing methods. In addition, the Gaussian function has some nice mathematical properties, such as being infinitely differentiable, which makes it a good choice for some applications.
However, one disadvantage of Gaussian smoothing is that it can introduce some lag in the signal, because the smoothing effect extends to neighboring data points. Additionally, Gaussian smoothing is sensitive to the choice of the kernel width, and it may not be the best choice for all types of signals or noise.
